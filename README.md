# **The openspace-organizer**

The Open Space Organizer is a Python program designed to assist in seating arrangements for an open space with six tables, each with a fixed number of seats (four seats). It ensures that seating is organized efficiently and fairly, considering the capacity of the space and the number of people to be seated.

## The program's features:
 - random assignment of individuals to seats across several tables.
 - handling of cases when the number of individuals exceeds the capacity of the open space
 - displaying and storing the final seating arrangement

## Installation:
 - clone the GitHub repository to your own computer
 - make sure you have the latest python interpreter installed
 - the program also uses the following packages: pandas, random and csv
 - you can run the program from the main.py file

 ## How to use:
 - you can run the main.py file, which will ask you to input a file: this needs to be an xlsx file, with the name of people to be seated.
 - once you input the file, the program will randomly assign these names to the seats at the tables
 - once the program is done, it will ask you to input a filename, where the resutlts of the allocation can be stored on your computer.

 # Have fun seating!!
